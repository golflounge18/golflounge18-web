                    “When young, aspiring players employ an additional 10-20 hours of
                    practice on top of their weekly lessons, the success of that invested
                    time is primarily dictated by how well they adhere to the instructions
                    prescribed by their coach.”</i></p>

                How do coaches ensure their teaching instructions not only stick with their young
                players but that they also ‘practice as prescribed’ without constant supervision?
            </u></strong></p>
            <p>
                In a self-administered practice environment, players follow a customized training plan,
                where personalized drills and tests are performed in front of a TrackMan. By doing so,
                students follow a predefined path of learning while their performance (data) is captured
                for review and analysis after the session.
            </p>
            <p>
                This results in a shift of coaching philosophy towards emphasizing skill over style and technique.
            </p>
            <p><i>
                “Technique still has a place in our coaching approach, but skill drives score and JumpStart is
                specifically geared toward accelerating skill development. Using TrackMan not only as a
                diagnostic tool but also as a stand-alone training tool, the program offers accelerated skill
                development through structured practice sessions for a lower price than traditional
                one-on-one golf lessons.”
            </i></p>
            <p>
                After an initial player evaluation, we build a weekly training program for the players.
                Once a student arrives at the facility, he or she signs into the TrackMan Performance Studio software
                and performs the predefined, personalized training session autonomously. Once completed, the player
                hands in the completed assignment and based on the outcome, the coach adjusts the training plan
                for subsequent weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only requirement for students participating in the JumpStart program is that they are
                mature enough to do the required work on their own. A small, initial TrackMan introduction
                is therefore often necessary.
            </p>
            <p><i>
                “They need a little training, but it’s not hard. We basically set up everything in advance,
                so they walk over and start practicing.”
            </i></p>
            <p>
                Jumpstart is not meant to be a stand-alone program but serves as an addendum to the players
                overall training curriculum. “It’s a way of accelerating a player’s development through a
                predefined curriculum and, at the same time, ensuring that they stay on track with their
                overall training goals.”
