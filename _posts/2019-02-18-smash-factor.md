excerpt:
  Compress the ball more for better smash factor and distance
---

Smash factor is a number that shows the amount of energy transferred from club face to the ball.
The calculation is made by dividing ball speed over club speed.
So if you have a club head speed with a driver at 100 mph and ball speed of 150,
your smash factor is 1.50.

The **optimal smash factor** is 1.50 with a driver and a pitching wedge would be optimal at 1.25.

Smash factor is based off the compression of the ball, where on the face impact is made
and the club head speed. If the three of these criteria are met with a driver you should
see a smash factor at 1.50 or close to. Improving/ Making your smash factor higher will
increase your distance with every club. When looking at the smash factor, focus on:
* where on the face the ball is making contact and
* the angle of attack to make sure you are compressing the ball correctly (not too shallow and not too steep).

If you manage to increase your smash factor you can see up to 15-20 extra yards off the tee
and 5-10 yards with your irons while still swinging at the same speed.
